README

To install phylobyte, make sure you have MySQL configured and running.
You should have a user with full access (except Grant, which is not required)
to a database.

Put Phylobyte in a directory you have access to, and visit the admin/ directory.

You will be prompted to enter your database connection information and
create your admin user. Please make sure that the data/ directory is
writable by your web server. If the configuration does not happen as expected,
delete the dbconfig.array file from the data/ directory. Then, clear your session
by appending ?phylobyte=logout to your admin/ directory URL.

Phylobyte requires that you have PHP 5.1 or higher, and PDO support.

Notes for Arch Linux Installation:
1) Follow the steps on the Arch Linux LAMP wiki page (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LAMP)
2) Uncomment the line ;extension=pdo_mysql.so
