</h3>

<p>
The image management plugin for Phylobyte helps you organize libraries of images in either JPEG or PNG format.
</p> 

<p>
Create a new collection to start uploading images, or select an existing collection
to view and manipulate the current contents, or add new content.
</p>

<p>To view a collection and upload images, highlight your target collection by clicking the radio button,
and click "Select Collection". Your selected collection will be remembered by the plugin.
</p>

<p>
Each collection is followed by a preview of six of the images. The total number of images
in each collection is displayed in the "Total Images" column.
