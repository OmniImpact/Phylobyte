<h3>API Test</h3>
<p>
The API is designed to allow functions to be performed in a consistent and useful language.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
To use the API, send a standard HTTP POST request to http://example.com/api.php.
</p>
<p>
The API accepts four arguments, all as named POST input. They are "for", "do", "token", and "with".
"for" is the user ID of the account you want to perform a function for. "do" is the action, and specifies
what function you want to perform. "token" is the method of verification. A token is assigned on login,
and is used as a security key. The correct token must be passed with a user ID in order to perform
account specific functions. If no "for" or "token" arguments are passed, there are a limited number
of functions that can be performed, such as registering a new user. Any additional information is passed
as a JSON object, usually key-value pairs, in the "with" attribute.
</p>

<h3>Return</h3>
<p>
The API returns a JSON object. The returned object will contain five keyed objects.
"success" is a boolean true or false, stating whether the request was successful.
"timestamp" is the UNIX timestamp that the request was performed. "exectime" is used
to detect performance problems, and is the API request execution time in microseconds.
"message" is an English-language explanation of what happened. This can be presented
to the user if needed, or used by a developer to diagnose problems performing operations
with the API. "data" is a JSON object, usually key-value pairs that give the results
of the operation.
