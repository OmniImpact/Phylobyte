<h3>What are Groups?</h3>

<p>These <em>Primary Groups</em> dicate the privilages granted to a user by Phylobyte CMS. Although various plugins and extensions can add more fine-grained group and permission management, this simple system will be sufficient for most general needs.</p>

<h3>The Admin Group</h3>

<p>The <em>admin</em> group allows access to Phylobyte CMS. <strong>Do NOT delete the <em>admin</em> group, or remove all users from the admin group, or you can not access Phylobyte CMS.</strong></p>

<h3>Managing Groups</h3>

<p>You likely won't want to do much with the goups here, they will mostly be created by other plugins. You should use this tool as a sort of reference as you create new users and logins to give people the permissions you want.</p>
