The file management plugin for Phylobyte helps you browse and manage files in general.

The file manager shows folders and folder operations in the left most column. To go to the base directory
where all your files are stored, click "Files Root". To go to the parent directory of your current location,
click "Up A Level". Files in your current location are displayed in the center panel. Click the
<i class="icon-info-sign"></i> icon to show file information
and options on the right.

Once you click to view file information and options, you can rename and delete the selected file.
