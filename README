PLACEHOLDER README FILE

To install this application, simply drop it into your DocumentRoot for 
your HTTP server (configured for PHP modules and MySQL database 
interaction).

Alternatively, if you are like me and you keep all your development 
projects in a separate directory, you may use symlinks.

1) Navigate to your DocumentRoot for your HTTP server
2) Run this command:
    ln -s <location of Phylobyte> phylobyte

* If you're using '/srv/http', then you need to run this command as 
root.
** This only works if your HTTP server is configured to allow symlinks.



Arch Installation:
