Equatec is a simple tool to help test your product.
</p>

<p><strong>Projects</strong><br/>
You can create multiple projects to track.
Each project contains features and test cases.
</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong><br/>
Within a project, add a feature to start testing.
With each feature, you will be able to define test cases.
When you perform a test, the results are tallied, and
the resulting rating is applied to that feature.
</p>

<p><strong>Cases</strong><br/>
In order to create a test, create cases.
Describe what you expect to happen when the test is performed.
</p>

<p><strong>Submitting Results</strong><br/>
To submit results, you will enter the outcomes of the test cases.
You may provide a note about what actually happened, and whether
the case failed or passed. Pass/Fail results count towards the resulting rating.
</p>

<p><strong>Viewing Results</strong><br/>
EQuATeC keeps a record of tests, not just the latest.
Viewing results will show a breakdown of the submitted tests
so that you can track the progress of that feature.
